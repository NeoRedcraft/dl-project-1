# Classifying and Segmenting Multiple Ocular Diseases Using Deep Learning Based on Retinal Imaging
This study presents a deep learningâ€“based framework for the classification and segmentation of multiple ocular diseases using retinal images. 
The system employs the YOLOv12 segmentation architecture, trained on the RetinaVision dataset composed of curated fundus images annotated for cataract, 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and pathologic myopia. The dataset was divided into an 80-10-10 split for training, validation, and testing, respectively. 
After 606 epochs, the model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.93 and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.767, demonstrating both excellent localization accuracy and strong generalization across ocular disease classes. 
These results highlight YOLOv12â€™s capacity for simultaneous detection and segmentation, indicating its potential for real-time ophthalmic screening applications.
